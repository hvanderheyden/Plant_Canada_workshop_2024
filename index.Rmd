Description 
-----

Metabarcoding combines DNA barcoding with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies for rapid and high-throughput identification of multiple species from environmental samples, offering a powerful tool for biodiversity studies and ecosystem monitoring. It has transformed our ability to profile complex microbial communities and track plant pathogens in various environments. 

This workshop will provide hands-on experience in metabarcoding-based community analysis using R, a versatile programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. You will learn about various R packages and tools that are essential for community data analysis, enabling you to effectively analyze and interpret metabarcoding data. 

This workshop is designed to demonstrate how you may use metabarcoding for plant pathogen monitoring and tracking. This is crucial for early detection and management of plant diseases and for agriculture and biodiversity conservation. We will explore case studies and practical applications, highlighting how metabarcoding, combined with R analysis, becomes a potential diagnostic tool for Biovigilance of phytopathogens.

What the workshop is not about 
-----

This workshop is not dedicated to learning the basics of R and R-studio. We believe there are plenty of tutorials and workshops available online or through research groups. Here are a few examples of resources for learning the basics: 

Sydney E. Everhart, Nikita Gambhir, Kaitlin Gold, Lucky Mehra and Zhian N. Kamvar offered APS attendees an introduction to R for plant pathologists in 2020, available at:

https://github.com/everhartlab/APS_IntroR_2020

Several tutorials and primers are also available from the Grunwald group. See, for example, this primer on reproducible science using R, prepared by Zachary S.L. Foster, Zhian N. Kamvar, and Niklaus J. Grünwald: 

https://grunwaldlab.github.io/Reproducible-science-in-R/

The Centre québécois des sciences de la biodiversité (CQBS) also offers a wide range of training courses at various levels, from introduction classes to advanced multivariate analyses:

Another great source of R tutorials and codes is the Riffomonas code club page:

Data were collected once a week in 2021 in the southwest Montreal Muck soil region using a Cyclone sampler. DNA extractions were performed in Dr. Chen's laboratory and sequenced on Illumina (Chen), IonTorrent (Bilodeau) and Nanopore (Van der Heyden).

Data were collected by Dr. Carrisse's team once a week in 2021 in the Muck's region southwest of Montreal using a Cyclone sampler (Figure 1). DNA extractions were performed in Dr. Chen's laboratory and sequenced on Illumina (Chen--oomycetes only), IonTorrent (Bilodeau--oomycetes only) and Nanopore (Van der Heyden--oomycetes and fungi). Illumina and IonTorrent data were analysed using Dr Marc-Olivier Duceppe's pipeline (avilable here: https://github.com/duceppemo/QIIME2_ITS) with a database modified from UNITE v9.0 (2023-07-18), while Nanopore data were analysed using a custom script based on Minimap2.
